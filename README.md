# Dependency

This is a fork of Stuart Sierra's [Dependency][] library that adds
an optional comparator to the `topo-sort` function that provides
secondary ordering when the dependency order is ambiguous. This change
was made so that `topo-sort` can be deterministic.

In all other respects, this library is the same. Please see Stuart's
[README][] for more information.
